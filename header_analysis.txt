🔍 Header Red Flags:

1. **Return-Path Mismatch**
   - Email says it's from `morganstanley-careers.com`
   - But the return path shows: `scammer@cheap-fakejobs.com`
   - 🚩 This indicates spoofing or bounce-back redirection

2. **Suspicious IP Address**
   - The sending server: `185.250.54.29`
   - Whois lookup shows it’s not tied to Morgan Stanley or any legit provider

3. **Lack of DKIM/SPF Verification**
   - In real email headers, you'd see SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass or fail status
   - In phishing emails, this often fails or is missing completely

4. **Generic “To” Field**
   - Sent to: `you@example.com` or `Undisclosed Recipients`
   - No personalized greeting, which real companies use

5. **No Reply-To or Signed-By**
   - Missing metadata that most legit corporate emails include

✅ Conclusion:

This header contains clear spoofing signals and weak authentication. Combined with domain mismatches and shady IPs, it’s a textbook phishing email.
